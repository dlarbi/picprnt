Instagram application for printing photos based on tags

1) Users make subscription

2) Users tag #prnt on an instagram photo

3) Their tag is detected, and their photo is added to picprnt's database for printing and shipping

The application also supports events, which is neat. You get a cool perspective of your party/birthday/wedding/etc that is candid and from the perspective of your guests.  You can:

1) Register your event (ie a wedding)

2) Have your guests check-in when they attend your event by clicking one button

3) All your guest's photos are shipped to the event originator (for the duration you specified for your event)

Although it was just an experiment in building a "complete" webapp, This application is pretty well developed and close to ready for users if launched!  Users can control their account options, make real payments, view their queued photos for printing.

The application is mainly PHP, written almost entirely from scratch, and follows a simple-to-follow MVC pattern to initialize a controller based on URL paths, and call methods to get data from models and render views.
